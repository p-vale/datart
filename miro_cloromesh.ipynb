    "# Joan Miró\n",
    "For all his life, Miró was in contact with multiple artistic movements, but he never really became an official member of any.\n",
    "Through the mid-1920s Miró developed the pictorial sign language: organic forms and flattened picture planes drawn with a sharp line.\n",
    "The contour line isn't always present, and figures can be [more](https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro/cap-d-home) or [less](https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro/head-of-a-man) abstract. The areas of colour are the real constant even in his [sculptures](https://www.joan-miro.net/construction.jsp).\n",
    "\n",
    "Topographic maps and pcloromesh can be visually similar to his work."
